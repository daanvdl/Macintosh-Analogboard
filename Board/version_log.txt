V2.3:
• Removed dots in resistor values on silkscreen (ie 1.5 did become 1R5)
• Added film and ceramic capacitor values to silkscreen
• Revised BOM

V2.2.1:
• Minor silkscreen corrections

V2.2:
• Added resistor values to silkscreen due to differences in common documentation which is based on early international boards or US boards
• Added capacitor values to silkscreen due to differences in common documentation which is based on early international boards or US boards

V2.1:
• Removed track wich caused a short between R2 and R3 which caused to 
• Corrected mising 0.6MM track at R17
• Added filmcap replacement possibility at C1
• Added boardversion to silkscreen
• Updated resistor and diode values to 'real' values instead of relying on Larry Pina's outdated BOM's
• Added schematics of power circuit of this -D revision board

V2.0: 
• Corrected CR20 to CR21 error on silkscreen

V1.5:
• First production batch deployed

V1.0: 
• Initial release
